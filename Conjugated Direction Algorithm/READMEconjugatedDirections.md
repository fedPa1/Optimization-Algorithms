#The script is an algorithm that works in 2 variables quadratic functions to find the global minimum using the conjugated direction method

#References: https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt-F13/scribes/lec10.pdf

#Notation:
#^t indicates the transposed operator in arrays
#* indicates multiplication sign except in x* indicating a point in R^2

#Why use conjugated directions method?
#(1)Accelarate the convergence rate of steepest decent.
#(2)Avoiding the high computational cost Newtonâ€™s method
