Implementation of linear optimization algorithms in python

#The script is an algorithm that works in 2 variables quadratic functions to find the global minimum
#using the conjugated directions method

#Why use conjugated directions method?
#(1)Accelarate the convergence rate of steepest decent.
#(2)Avoiding the high computational cost Newtonâ€™s method
