# Optimization-Algorithms

#Implementation of Armijo's rule in python

#The script is an algorithm that works in 2 variables functions to find an alpha step that minimise the function in a given direction
#takes as input a 2 variables function f(x[0],x[1]) ,x s.t. x=[x[0],x[1]], 
#d s.t. d=[d[0],d[1]]
#d must be a descent initial direction to gaurantee an alpha step that minimizes the function will be found
